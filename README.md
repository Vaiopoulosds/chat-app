<h1>This is a full stack app using django-rest-framework as back-end and react as front-end.<h1/> <br/>
<h2>In this app you will find a fully functional chat application. You can register, login and have access to the chat.</h2> <br/>
<h3>At the backend we have django-rest-framework to server API endpoints so that we can have a database (mysql) that stores all the data.</h3>
  <p>That gives us the ability to serve the data as a form of conversation history to the user. </p>
<h3>At the frontend we have react building the UI plus using react-query so that we have quick responses from the server ( invalidating the queries/ short refetching intervals).</h3>
  <br>
<strong>The app contains dockerfiles so you can run it at a docker container!!</strong>
